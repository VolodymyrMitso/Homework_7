        The Command Palette holds infrequently used functionality,
        like sorting, changing the syntax and changing the indentation
        settings. With just a few keystrokes, you can search for what you
        want, without ever having to navigate through the menus or remember
        obscure key bindings.

        When you need to focus, Distraction Free Mode is there to help you out.
        Distraction Free Mode is full screen, chrome free editing, with nothing
        but your text in the center of the screen. You can incrementally show
        elements of the UI, such as tabs and the find panel, as you need them.

        Projects in Sublime Text capture the full contents of the workspace,
        including modified and unsaved files. You can switch between projects
        in a manner similar to Goto Anything, and the switch is instant, with
        no save prompts - all your modifications will be restored next time the
        project is opened.
